# Clinical Imaging v0.1 ‚Äî Grad-CAM Demo (NOT FOR CLINICAL USE)

**What:** Upload a chest image (PNG/JPG/DICOM) ‚Üí get a toy prediction + a Grad-CAM heatmap showing where the model ‚Äúlooked‚Äù.  
**Why (for recruiters):** Demonstrates handling of medical imaging formats (DICOM), AI model inference, and visual explainability in a clean, reproducible app.

---

## üöÄ Quick start

**Online demo:** _TBD (Hugging Face Spaces link)_  
**GitHub repo:** [Clinical AI v0.1](<repo-link>)

### Run locally
```bash
conda create -n clinical-ai-v0_1 python=3.11 -y
conda activate clinical-ai-v0_1
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

Features
DICOM support ‚Äî load .dcm files via pydicom with basic windowing.

Pretrained CNN inference (ResNet18, ImageNet weights, CPU-friendly).

Grad-CAM explainability with adjustable opacity slider.

Optional patient metadata (age, sex, symptoms) saved to CSV.

Export overlay as PNG for sharing or documentation.

Clean, medical-style UI with custom Streamlit theme.

Limitations
Toy prediction only (brightness-based) ‚Äî not for clinical use.

No diagnostic claims.

Educational and portfolio purposes only.

Tech stack
Frontend/UI: Streamlit (custom CSS theme)
